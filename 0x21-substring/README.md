## 0x21. Substring with concatenated words
### This interview algorithm project finds all the possible substrings containing a list of words, within a given string.

#### Tasks : Substring with concatenated words

1- Write a function in C int *find_substring(char const *s, char const **words, int nb_words, int *n) that finds all possible substrings containing a list of words within a given string:
* s is the string to scan
* words is the array of words all substrings must be a concatenation arrangement of
* nb_words is the number of elements in the array words
* n holds the address at which to store the number of elements in the returned array
* returns an allocated array, storing each index in s, at which a substring was found or NULL if no solution is found
* all words in the array words are the same length
* a valid substring s is the concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters
